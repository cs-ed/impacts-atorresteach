# ==Impacts on Society==

Currently 7% of students at Indio High School take a computer science course, although no specialty courses are offered.  The first course I would implement at Indio High School would be AP Computer Science A.  This course would allow students to become familiar with the concepts and tools of computer science as you learn a subset of the Java programming language.  Students will gain hands-on work and collaboration skills to design, write, and test computer programs that solve problems or accomplish tasks with addressing the social impacts of computer science.  



## Plan

### Learning Objectives

- Designing a program, developing the algorithms it needs, and writing code to implement them
- Testing program code and correcting errors
- Documenting and explaining how program code works

Describe the learning objectives for the class that relate to social impacts. Consider using Bloom's Taxonomy to identify the types of cognitive and/or affective outcomes (and their associated verbs): https://bloomstaxonomy.net/

### Learning Activities

Describe the learning activities and how they will be incorporated into the class. For example, will they include class discussion, written reports, homework, or exams? Will the activity be a one-time lesson or used multiple times in class?

### Assessment

Describe how you plan to assess the learning objectives described above.

### Outcomes

Describe how your plan will facilitate diversity/equity/inclusion and help broadening participation in computing. Also describe how the course plan will help long-term goals in addressing computing impacts on society.
