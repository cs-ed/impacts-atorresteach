# Impacts on Society


Currently 7% of students at Indio High School take a computer science course, although no specialty courses are offered. Since 96% of the student body is Latino offering this course would provide a great oppurtinity to help gain traction on the diversity gap in the computer science industry. Only 24% of those taking a computer science course are female, so finding ways to recruit more female students would be a focus during course request times at the end of the year. The first course I would implement at Indio High School would be AP Computer Science Principles.  This course would allow students to become familiar with the concepts and tools of computer science as you learn a subset of the Java programming language.  Students will gain hands-on work and collaboration skills to design, write, and test computer programs that solve problems or accomplish tasks while learning about and addressing the social impacts of computer science. This would be considered an introductory computer science course open to students who have completed Integrated Math I with a C or better. 



## AP Computer Science Principles

### Learning Objectives

- Designing a program, developing the algorithms it needs, and writing code to implement them
- Testing program code and correcting errors
- Documenting and explaining how program code works

###Unit 1: Intro to Computer Science and Algorithms
| *Unit 1*| *Topics/Activites* |  *Big Ideas-CRD, AAP, IOC* |

| *Blooms Taxonomy*| *Goals* |   	
| :---:	| :---:|
|  Recall Facts and Basic Concepts - Remember	|  Students will need to define  	|   
|  Explain Ideas and Concepts - Understand 	|  Students will need to design a program and provide an explanation of how the alogorithm will functions 	|   
|  Use Information in New Situations - Apply	| Students will use information they have learned about algorithms to determine if a given algorithm could have either a positive or negative affect in society. Students will determine   	|   	
|  Draw Connections Among Ideas - Analyze  |  |
|  Justify a Stand or Decision - Evaluate  |  |
|  Produce New or Original Work - Create |  |




### Learning Activities

Describe the learning activities and how they will be incorporated into the class. For example, will they include class discussion, written reports, homework, or exams? Will the activity be a one-time lesson or used multiple times in class?

### Assessment

Describe how you plan to assess the learning objectives described above.

### Outcomes

Describe how your plan will facilitate diversity/equity/inclusion and help broadening participation in computing. Also describe how the course plan will help long-term goals in addressing computing impacts on society.
