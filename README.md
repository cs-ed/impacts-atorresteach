# <p align="center"> Creating Social Change through Computer Science 


<p align="center"> Currently 7% of students at Indio High School take a computer science course, although no specialty courses are offered.Since 96% of the student body is Latino offering this course would provide a great oppurtinity to help gain traction on the diversity gap in the computer science industry. Currently only 24% of those taking a computer science course are female, so finding ways to recruit more female students would be a focus during course request times at the end of the year. 

<p align="center">The first course I would implement at Indio High School would be AP Computer Science Principles.  This course would allow students to become familiar with the concepts and tools of computer science as you learn to program in python.  Students will gain hands-on work and collaboration skills to design, write, and test computer programs that solve problems or accomplish tasks while learning about and addressing the social impacts of computer science. 
- <p align="center">This would be considered an introductory computer science course open to students who have completed Integrated Math I with a C or better.

### Learning Objectives
---

- Designing a program, developing the algorithms it needs, and writing code to implement them
- Testing program code and correcting errors
- Documenting and explaining how program code works


### How will students demonstrate the social impact of Computer Science on society?

| :---:	| :---:|:---:|
| 1.|Recall Facts and Basic Concepts - Remember	|Students will be able to recognize and define various parts of a computer and algorithm. Students will also learn about the opportunities that Computer Science provides to society and how they can be both positive and negative. |   
| 2.|Explain Ideas and Concepts - Understand 	|  Students will need to design a program and provide an explanation of how the alogorithm will function.	|   
| 3.| Use Information in New Situations - Apply	| Students will use information they have learned about algorithms to determine if a written or given algorithm could have either a positive or negative affect in society. Students will write up explanations of these impacts and look for ways to improve the algorithm, or ensure it is accessible to all demographics. |  	|   	
| 4.|Draw Connections Among Ideas - Analyze  | Students will analyze algorithms and programs in both a social context and in a formal algorithm and program and determine ways to improve it to meet the needs of society|
| 5.| Justify a Stand or Decision - Evaluate  | Students evaluate algorithms written by their peers and used constructive feedback in order to create a classroom culture of support that fosters a learning environment |
| 6.| Produce New or Original Work - Create | Students will demonstrate learning by creating a solution through producing an alogorithm, a program, or writing response that addresses the positive and negative impacts a particular computer innovation has and ways that we can make it better. |  |

| |What is computer science and why should we study it? (Videos, discussion, readings, blogs)| Lesson: Improving skin tone representation across Google -Weekly articles will Students learn about problems in the computer science field.  Students will see how AI has changed the compter science field, but also how it hinders various demographics due to its lack of diversity in the algorithm.  Changes are currently being made for better facial recognition software?  Students will research the positives and negatives of AI on facial recgonition, and determine what demographics have been negatively impacted by this software.  Student groups will present a list of 5 affects AI facial recognition has had on society. https://blog.google/products/search/monk-skin-tone-scale/ |
| |Intro to Collaboration (Pogil Activity)|Lesson: Air Quality Index Calculator -Students will make a calulaton to determine the Air Quality Index of Different places around the United States.  Students will begin to look at the difference in Air Quality by City and States with the United States.  Students will answer the following questions, What do you notice? What do you wonder? What are variables that might impact the differences between these places? https://www.engage-csedu.org/find-resources/air-quality-index-calculator   |
||Computing Innovations (Drones, Self-DrivingCars, selections from students)|Lesson: What Are Innovations In Computer Science?  Students will research innovations driven by computer science.  They will present using google slides on two innovations and how they have impacted society.  They will need to look at social impact, political impact, and accessibility to the general population and if income or race has placed any limits on this.  https://thesassway.com/what-are-innovations-in-computer-science/|
||Algorithms (Video, PB&J, Guide Leading Blind, Flowcharts, Robot Game, CSP’s Got Game! Pseudocode, Efficiency, Relationship to Computer Programs|Students are given a task to create a set of instructions to give to a “guide” to help a “visually impaired” friend get from “home” to “work” to “lunch” and then back “home.”  This lesson is to start students thinking about process of creating an algorithm.  Students will discover that although their intent was to create something that was helpful to someone, it may lack something and therefore cause harm or impair someone from meeting there goal.  Students will revise their instructions to see if after paying attention to detail if they are able to create a safe walk home for their "visually impaired" friend. https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/courses/ap-computer-science-principles |

### Outcomes

To broaden participation in computing it is important to create and fostor a positive learning environment.  The largest obstacle is getting students to perservere and recognize their learning success. By creating a collaborative learning environment where students feel they can fail without judgment, they will open themselves up to asking questions and gaining feedback.  The greatest measure of success for an elective class like this is word of mouth from peer to peer.  Creating a class that students find enjoyable and rewarding, while also maintaining its objective and rigor is the key to creating long-term goals at our site to address the gap in minorities entering the field.  The goal would be to start with 1 class and by three years have 3 classes, and continue to work on increasing those numbers and adding more classes into the schedule that build on this framework.
