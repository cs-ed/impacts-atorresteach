# <p align="center"> Creating Social Change through Computer Science 


<p align="center"> Currently 7% of students at Indio High School take a computer science course, although no specialty courses are offered.Since 96% of the student body is Latino offering this course would provide a great oppurtinity to help gain traction on the diversity gap in the computer science industry. Currently only 24% of those taking a computer science course are female, so finding ways to recruit more female students would be a focus during course request times at the end of the year. 

<p align="center">The first course I would implement at Indio High School would be AP Computer Science Principles.  This course would allow students to become familiar with the concepts and tools of computer science as you learn to program in python.  Students will gain hands-on work and collaboration skills to design, write, and test computer programs that solve problems or accomplish tasks while learning about and addressing the social impacts of computer science. 
- <p align="center">This would be considered an introductory computer science course open to students who have completed Integrated Math I with a C or better.

Students will begin to look at the difference in Air Quality by City and States with the United States.  Students will answer the following questions, What do you notice? What do you wonder? What are variables that might impact the differences between these places?  |

| :---:	| :---:|
|  Recall Facts and Basic Concepts - Remember	|Students will be able to recognize and define various parts of a computer and algorithm|   
|  Explain Ideas and Concepts - Understand 	|  Students will need to design a program and provide an explanation of how the alogorithm will function.	|   
|  Use Information in New Situations - Apply	| Students will use information they have learned about algorithms to determine if a written or given algorithm could have either a positive or negative affect in society. Students will write up explanations of these impacts and look for ways to improve the algorithm, or ensure it is accessible to all demographics. |  	|   	
|  Draw Connections Among Ideas - Analyze  | Students will analyze algorithms and programs in both a social context and in a formal algorithm and program and determine ways to improve it to meet the needs of society|
|  Justify a Stand or Decision - Evaluate  | Students evaluate algorithms written by their peers and used constructive feedback in order to create a classroom culture of support that fosters a learning environment |
|  Produce New or Original Work - Create | Students will demonstrate learning by creating a solution through producing an alogorithm, a program, or writing response that addresses the positive and negative impacts a particular computer innovation has and ways that we can make it better. |  |




### Learning Activities

Unit 1 Activity for Algorithms (AAP) (P2) CR3

\
Lesson: Students are given a task to create a set of instructions to give to a “guide” to help a “visually impaired” person get from “home” to “work” to “lunch” and then back “home.”  This lesson is to start students thinking about process of creating an algorithm. The lesson will begin the discussion of the impact computer science has on society.  Students will discover that although their intent was to create something that was helpful to someone, it may lack something and therefore cause harm or impair someone from meeting there goal.

Directions: 
- In groups of 2 or 3, students write detailed instructions to direct a “blind” person from one location to another and then another in Google Docs. 
- They test their instructions within the group and then print out and share the instructions with another group where they will use the instructions to create a map.  
- The designated guide will read instructions EXACTLY as they are written and the designated blind person will do EXACTLY what the instructions say to do. 
- The recorder will take notes about any issues observed from this activity. 
- Groups will discuss the experience and problems they uncovered with their instructions. Students will revise the directions in an attempt to provide a better 
- For homework, students will rewrite the algorithm basedon the feedback and experience of the activity. 

### Assessment

Students will be assesed using a method that incorporates art: After making initial corrections to the instuctions used in the te visual art or photography or videography as an assessment tool. Whether students draw, create a collage, or sculpt, you may find that the assessment helps them synthesize their learning. Or think beyond the visual and have kids act out their understanding of the content. 

### Outcomes

Describe how your plan will facilitate diversity/equity/inclusion and help broadening participation in computing. Also describe how the course plan will help long-term goals in addressing computing impacts on society.
